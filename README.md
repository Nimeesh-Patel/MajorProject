# Twitter Clone

This project recreates a simplified Twitter interface using **React** and **Firebase**. It was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. Run tests once in CI mode:
   ```bash
   CI=true npm test
   ```

The Firebase configuration in `src/firebase.js` points to a demo project so you can see sample tweets without additional setup.

## Available Scripts

The following commands are provided by Create React App:
- `npm start` – start the dev server
- `npm test` – run tests in watch mode
- `npm run build` – create a production build
- `npm run eject` – copy configuration files locally (not reversible)

For more details, see the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
